###Welcome to my GitHub Page!

This course has been my first introduction to writing in code languages and GitHub.

## A little bit about me

I am a Commerce and Arts conjoint student and am currently in my 4th year here at the University of Auckland. 

Outside of Univeristy, I have a part time job (*shameless plug for [HOYTS](https://www.hoyts.co.nz)*) and have a passion for playing detective üîç when watching true crime shows and podcasts.
